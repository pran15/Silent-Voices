# SILENT VOICES:
One of the standard sign language techniques is the use of hand gestures. The ability of mute people to communicate with others is highly limited. This project aims to facilitate the diagnosis process of the mute patients via using hand gesture recognition system that housed in a right-hand glove and contain three flex sensors for three finger, converted to audio to help the doctor to make the right diagnosis, The system will compare the identified signal with stored data when itâ€™s matched an mp3 audio file will be played as an output. This recognition system is designed to identify six hand gesture-already familiar to the patients- each of these gestures represent a phrase that is an answer to question asked frequently when seeing the general practitioner.
# HARDWARE REQUIRED:
